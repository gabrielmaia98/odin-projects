            </ol>
            <li><strong>Make the ricotta mixture:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Layer the lasagna:</strong></li>
            <ol type="i">
